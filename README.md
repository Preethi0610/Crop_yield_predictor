# Crop Yield Prediction Tool

A machine learning based crop yield prediction application built to estimate agricultural productivity using environmental and regional factors such as weather conditions, soil characteristics and location specific attributes. The project focuses on building a reliable prediction pipeline that supports data driven decision making for agricultural planning and resource optimization.

## Features
- Predicts crop yield using weather, soil and regional input features
- Implements a Random Forest based prediction model for robust performance
- Uses GridSearchCV for systematic hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluates model performance using confusion matrix, accuracy and classification report
- Provides a simple and easy to use interface for running predictions
- Implemented using Python and scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- Model: Random Forest classifier
- Model tuning: GridSearchCV
- Evaluation metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy score and F1 score
